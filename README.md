# Semantic serach of IIT Hyderabad faculties by their research interests
In this project we aim to implement semantic serach of IIT Hyderabad faculties by their states research interests in their institute webpage

Head over to ![Demo app](https://arvindroshaan-project-sem-researchintsemanticsearchstapp-ecc7qh.streamlit.app/) and have a look!

The IIT Hyderabad webpage currently allows only exact search by faculty research interest. Below is an example for the keyword "Computer Vision". As you can see only three faculties have Computer Vision as their research interest

We aim to do an upgrade on the exact search using semantic serach and hopefully get this upgrade integrated in the official IIT Hyderabad webpage
